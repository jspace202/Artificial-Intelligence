Install necessary packages using:

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install scikit-learn

It took me approximately 3 minutes to compile the
model in hw4q2.py

When running hw4q3.py, the ResNet50 model will take 
several hours to train based on the input_shape
This is how long it took me to train:
input_shape(32, 32, 3) - approximately 2 hours
input_shapte(128, 128, 3) - approximately 6 hours
